<details>
<summary>Linux Accounts & Groups (Users & Permissions Part 1)</summary>
 <br />

**Locations of Access Control Files:**
- /etc/passwd
- /etc/shadow
- /etc/group
<!-- -->
- `sudo adduser [username]` = Create a new user
- `sudo passwd [username]` = Change password of a user
- `su - [username]` = Login as username ('su' = short for substitute or switch user)
- `su -` = Login as root
<!-- -->
- `sudo groupadd [groupname]` = Create new group (System assigns next available GID)
- `sudo adduser [username]` = Switch to Insert Mode

**Note 2 different User/Group commands:**<br />
`adduser`, `addgroup`, `deluser`,  `delgroup` = interactive, more user friendly commands<br />
`useradd`, `groupadd`,  `userdel`,  `groupdel` = low-level utilities, more infos need provided by yourself

- `sudo usermod [OPTIONS] [username]` = Modify a user account
- `sudo usermod -g devops tom` = Assign 'devops' as the primary group for 'tom' user
- `sudo delgroup tom` = Removes group 'tom'
- `groups` = Display groups the current logged in user belongs to
- `groups [username]` = Display groups of the given username
- `sudo useradd -G devops nicole` = Create 'nicole' user and add nicole to 'devops' group (-G = secondary group, not primary)
- `sudo gpasswd -d nicole devops` = Removes user 'nicole' from group 'devops'

<summary>File Ownership & Permissions (Users & Permissions Part 2)</summary>
 <br />

- `ls -l` = Print files in a long listing format, you can see ownership and permissions of the file

**Ownership:**
- `sudo chown [username]:[groupname] [filename]` = Change ownership
- `sudo chown tom:admin test.txt` = Change ownership of 'test.txt' file to 'tom' and group 'admin'
- `sudo chown admin test.txt` = Change ownership of 'test.txt' 'admin' user
- `sudo chgrp devops test.txt` = Make 'devops' group owner of test.txt file

**Possible File Permissions (Symbolic):**
- r = Read
- w = Write
- x = Execute
- '-' = No permission

**Change File Permissions for different owners**

File Permissions can be changed for:
- u = Owner
- g = Group
- o = Other (all other users)

Minus (-) removes the permission
- `sudo chmod -x api` = Takes 'execute' permission away for 'api' folder from all owners
- `sudo chmod g-w config.yaml` = Takes 'write' permission away for 'config.yaml' file from the group 

Plus (+) adds permission
- `sudo chmod g+x config.yaml` = Add 'execute' permission for 'config.yaml' file to the group 
- `sudo chmod u+x script.sh` = Add 'execute' permission for 'script.sh' file to the user 
- `sudo chmod o+x script.sh` = Add 'execute' permission for 'script.sh' file to other 

Change multiple permissions for an owner
- `sudo chmod g=rwx config.yaml` = Assign 'read write execute' permissions to the group
- `sudo chmod g=r-- config.yaml` = Assign only 'read' permission to the group

Changing permissions with numeric values

_Set permissions for all owners with 3 digits, 1 digit for each owner_ [Absolute vs Symbolic Mode](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/805-7229/6j6q8svd8/)

- 0 = No permission
- 1 = Execute
- 2 = Write
- 3 = Execute + Write
- 4 = Read
- 5 = Read + Execute
- 6 = Read + Write
- 7 = Read + Write + Execute
<!-- -->
- `sudo chmod 777 script.sh` = rwx (Read, Write and Execute) permission for everyone for file 'script.sh'
- `sudo chmod 740 script.sh` = Give user all permissions (7), give group only read permission (4), give other no permission (0)

<summary>Pipes & Redirects</summary>
<br />

**Pipe & Less:**

Pipe Command:
- `|` = Pipe command = Pipes the output of the previous command as an input to the next command

Less Command:
- `less [filename]` = Displays the contents of a file or a command output, one page at a time. And allows to navigate forward and backward through the file

Different piping examples/use cases:
- `cat /var/log/syslog | less` = Pipes the output of 'syslog' file to less program.
- `ls /usr/bin | less` = Pipes the output of ls command to less program.
- `history | less` = Pipes the output of history command to less program.

**Pipe & Grep:**

Grep Command:
- `grep [pattern]` = Searches for a particular pattern of characters and displays all lines that contain that pattern

More piping examples/use cases:
- `history | grep sudo` = Look for any commands of history commands, which have 'sudo' word in it
- `history | grep "sudo chmod"` = Look for any commands of history commands, which have 'sudo chmod' phrase in it
- `history | grep sudo | less` = History output will pass output to grep and filter for 'sudo' and this output will again be piped or passed to less program
- `ls /usr/bin/ | grep java` = Filter ls output for java
- `cat Documents/java-app/config.yaml | grep ports` = See all 'ports' occurences in config.yaml file

**Redirects in Linux:**
- `>` = Redirect Operator = Takes the output from the previous command and sends it to a file that you give

Different redirects examples/use cases:
- `history | grep sudo > sudo-commands.txt` = Redirect output into a 'sudo-commands.txt' file
- `cat sudo-commands.txt > sudo-rm-commands.txt` = Redirect output of 'sudo-commands.txt' file into 'sudo-rm-commands.txt' file
- `history | grep rm > sudo-rm-commands.txt` = Redirect output of filtered history commands into existing 'sudo-rm-commands.txt' file. Note: Contents of file will be _overwritten_
- `history | grep rm >> sudo-rm-commands.txt` = Redirect output of filtered history commands into existing 'sudo-rm-commands.txt' file. Note: Contents of file will be _appended_
